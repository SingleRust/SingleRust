# Single Rust 🧬

## Introduction

Welcome to Single Rust 🚀, a pioneering library under development for the Rust programming language, focused on the future of production-grade, high-throughput analysis pipelines for single-cell data. Currently in its foundational phase, Single Rust is poised to leverage Rust's fearless concurrency model, aiming to transition single-cell data analysis from initial prototyping to robust, scalable deployments.

## Current Phase 🚧

- **Foundation Laying**: We're in the exciting early stages, laying the groundwork for what will become a comprehensive toolkit for single-cell analysis.
- **Community Building**: Join us in shaping the future of Single Rust. We're calling on developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to contribute to a project that combines the power of Rust with the intricacy of single-cell data.

## Planned Features 🌟

- **Production-Ready**: Aiming for a library that seamlessly scales analyses from the benchtop to the cloud.
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Utilizing Rust's concurrency model for safe, efficient parallel data processing.
- **Efficiency at Scale**: Designed with performance in mind, to handle large datasets with ease.
- **Open Collaboration**: We believe in the power of community-driven development and encourage contributions.

## Getting Involved 🤝

### Stay Tuned

As we're laying the initial bricks, the best way to get involved is to watch this space. Star or watch this repo for updates, and prepare your Rust environment to jump in once we're ready for contributions.

### Future Installation Instructions

Installation instructions will be provided as soon as the library is ready for early adopters to test and contribute.

### Contributing

Want to be part of the journey from the start? We're looking for ideas, feedback, and early contributions to set the direction of Single Rust. While the codebase is under preparation, we encourage you to share your thoughts and suggestions through issues on this GitHub repository.
